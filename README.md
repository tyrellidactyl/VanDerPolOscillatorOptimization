# VanDerPolOscillatorOptimization

Course assignment in Controls & Optimization: implement a van der pol oscillator in Matlab to generate unique oscillation plots. 

The system equation of the forced Van der Pol oscillator is:
... (see overview)
We will examine the performance of a sinusoid at regulating this system. 
Consider u(t) = Ksin(ωt) for different constants K and ω.
